This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

To run it:

1. Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en
2. After installing, find the path where it's installed.( C:\Program Files\nodejs or something similar) Copy that path.
3. Control Panel -> System & Settings -> System -> Advanced System Settings -> Environmental Variables -> System Variables -> Add new path and name it Node.js and paste the path there.
4. Click ok and restart
5. Download this file. Open in VSCode
6. Go to terminal
7. Type ```npm run dev```, then ctrl + click on the local link. And you can view the website.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server: 

Just to run and view the website: ```npm run dev```

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
